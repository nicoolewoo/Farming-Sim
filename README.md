# Farming-Sim
A fruit collecting game to run on a Game Boy Advance Emulator. 

Welcome to Strawberry Fields! In this game you're invited to collect 10 of our world famous strawberries from our field! But be careful, 
some of these strawberries are mutated, and will explode if you try to pick them!

Use the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move your basket and pick a strawberry! You win if you collect 10, but lose if you
accidently pick 1 of 3 mutated berries! Choose carefully!
